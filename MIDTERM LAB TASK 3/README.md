# Midterm Lab Task 3: Creating Pivot table and Dashboard
For this task I worked on organizing and showing data using Pivot Table and Dashboard in Excel. 
## Step 1: Prepared the Data
- Sal By Role, Sal By State, Sal by Size
- Create another tanle for JobTitle per sector
## Step 2: Create and Design the Dashboard with the following:
- The state with the most Number of Data Science.
- The Job Role with the Highest Average Salary (Complete the dashboard as shown below)
- The Company Size pays the Highest(Complete the dashboard as shown below)
- The Sector Employs the Lowest and Highest Data Science related Jobs
- The Sector has the Minimum Average Salary and Maximum average Salary
## Step 3:  Used Pivot Tables and Charts to Show Data
- Made Pivot Table to group salaries by role, state, and company size.
- Create Chart.
## Step 4: Create the Dashboard better
- Insert Slicers for Role Type, Size and State
- Insert MAP if your Excel version has one (2019 and up) 
- Apply your own design and colour settings to make your DASHBOARD look more
appealing and presentable.
